## Introduction
Basic baby trolley alarm prototype made with FRDM-KL05Z (ARM Cortex-M0+) and Bluetooth HC-06. (I2C and UART used)

## Short decription
The alarm goes on when the trolley has moved - because a sleeping in it child woke up or somebody tried to change the position of the trolley. This way LEDs go red and our smartphone application informs as about the situation. The alarm can be turned off also by the application.
